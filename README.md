# Object Oriented Design. Dormitory Management System

## Introduction

Here I have a task to project a system and implement it in Java code. The task consist:
1. Choose some topic and design a system using it;
2. Write down functional and non-functional requirements for the system;
3. Define the objects and classes in the system;
4. Create a class diagram which therefore will be represented in code;
5. Write down a Java code using created recently class diagram.

## Chosen topic

As a topic I decided to choose **the Dormitory management system** to develop.

## Project documentation

You can find project documentation [here](/pdf/oot.pdf), where the functional and non-functional requirements, objects and classes and code are represented and described.

## Code documentation

This project is also supported by the documentation of the code. You can find a documentation [following the link](https://nazaryimontytskyi.github.io/dormitory-management-system)
